## Project Overview

Predicting Prices of Used Phones and Tablets: Analyze the used device dataset, build a model that helps develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identify factors that significantly influence the price.

## Data Sources

The primary dataset utilized for this analysis is the “used_device_data.csv” file, which contains a range of attributes related to used and refurbished phones and tablets. The data was collected in 2021, providing valuable insights into various factors that influence device pricing and demand during that period.
